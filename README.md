# RE-Cheatsheets

A growing collection of reverse-engineering notes, case studies, and reusable artifacts (cheatsheets, scripts, project files).
The goal is clarity, reproducibility, and professionalism â€” useful for learning, personal reference, collaborators, and recruiters.

## What Lives Here

This repo is still small, but may grow into a learning hub. Contributions are welcome.

### Included:

-Markdown notes, timelines, indicators (hashes, URLs, mutexes, registry keys)
-Project files, scripts, small utilities
-YARA/CAPA rules, opcode pattern DBs, PE/ELF field maps, calling convention refs
-Final reports (PDF/MD), diagrams (CFGs, unpacking chains, control flow)

### Excluded or Restricted

-Malware binaries: do not commit live samples. Store off-repo (encrypted) and reference only by hash.
-Proprietary code/data: only public, licensed, or your own material.
-Sensitive IOCs that could harm users: redact where necessary.
